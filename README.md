# License-plate-blurring-with-OpenCV

#### The aim of the project is to blur out the contents of a Russian License plate in real time.
**This project is part of the https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/ course**

This project uses Haar Cascade Filters to detect and blur out the License Plates. This can be used for blurring different elements in a picture, by detecting those various elements using their corresponding Haar Cascade Features.
